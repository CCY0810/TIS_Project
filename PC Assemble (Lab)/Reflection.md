<h1>PC Assemble (Lab)</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>From participating in PC assemble, I have gained experience in how to disassemble and reassemble back the PC. Moreover, I have known that there are several types of hardware components in the PC used which are casing, power supply, cable, RAM, HDD, CPU Fan, motherboard and CPU. I have learned to disassemble the PC with instruction of lab assistants by opening casing, disconnect the cables, taking out power supply, RAM, HDD and CPU Fan. In addition, about reassembling PC, the steps are inversion of the steps of disassemble the PC.</p>
<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>The PC used for the PC assemble only contain basic components. In my opinion, I would suggest that in the future I can involve in more advanced PC assemble that involves more complicated components and wires. Besides, I also hope that the PC assemble can start from separated hardware components then only start to build so that I can have a deeper understanding on building a PC.</p>
<h3>Others:</h3>
<p>This PC assemble has sparked my curiosity and interest in building a PC from separated hardware components by myself. As a tech fan, I am very impressive that a PC that have powerful functions can built by using these electronic components. Besides, I also have learnt about the importance of teamwork and effective communication that can lead to success for this PC assemble since it is a group work.</p>
